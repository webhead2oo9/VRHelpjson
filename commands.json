However, when purchasing a cable there are a few things to take into account: \n\n**USB Connection types**\nUSB cables can come with multiple different connector types, the ones you want to be looking for are USB type A and USB type C. All current Quest devices use a USB C port, which means that your cable needs to have at least *one* USB C connector, the other end can be either A or C; other than their shape and respective port they offer no real difference in this use case and they will perform the same.\n\n**USB standards**\nUSB standards (data speed simply said) are important for link cables, any link cable used for any of the Quest devices should be USB 3.0, also known as USB 3.1 Gen 1, and USB 3.2 Gen 1x1.\nNote that USB 2.0 will provide a very poor experience so avoid using those.\nYou can find these types of cables on A and C through various retailers at various lengths, performance-wise they are all equal.\n\n**Length**\nFor an optimal experience you ideally want a cable that is 3-5m long, generally it is not recommended that USB 2.0/3.0 cables are longer than that.\n\n**Battery time with a USB cable**\nPlaytime will be increased using a cable, but it is not guaranteed that the cable provides infinite playtime. This is a limitation of many motherboards and the cable plays no role.\n\nFor cable recommendations with detailed descriptions, use /linkcables.",

It's used for video games and other interactive experiences.\n\n**Augmented Reality (AR)**: This adds computer-created elements to the real world. If you've played games where characters appear in the real world on your phone screen, or used a filter to add a hat to your selfie, that's AR!\n\n**Mixed Reality (MR)**: This is a blend of AR and VR. Here, virtual objects are added to the real world and can interact with it. It's like having virtual objects in your living room that you can move and touch."
