      "description": "Connecting your Quest VR headset with your VR ready PC using a USB cable allows you to play VR games from your PC, this includes Oculus rift games and Steam games. However, when purchasing a cable there are a few things to take into account: \n\n**USB Connection types**\nUSB cables can come with multiple different connector types, the ones you want to be looking for are USB type A and USB type C. All current Quest devices use a USB C port, which means that your cable needs to have at least *one* USB C connector, the other end can be either A or C; other than their shape and respective port they offer no real difference in this use case and they will perform the same.\n\n**USB standards**\nUSB standards (data speed simply said) are important for link cables, any link cable used for any of the Quest devices should be USB 3.0, also known as USB 3.1 Gen 1, and USB 3.2 Gen 1x1.\nNote that USB 2.0 will provide a very poor experience so avoid using those.\nYou can find these types of cables on A and C through various retailers at various lengths, performance-wise they are all equal.\n\n**Length**\nFor an optimal experience you ideally want a cable that is 3-5m long, generally it is not recommended that USB 2.0/3.0 cables are longer than that.\n\n**Battery time with a USB cable**\nPlaytime will be increased using a cable, but it is not guaranteed that the cable provides infinite playtime. This is a limitation of many motherboards and the cable plays no role.\n\nFor cable recommendations with detailed descriptions, use /linkcables.",

Better customization, reliability, and actively maintained. \"It just works.\"\n\n**Steam Link** (Free)\nValve's official solution with good performance. Will be the native option for the upcoming Steam Frame headset.\n\n**ALVR** (Free, Open Source)\nCompletely free alternative. Less user-friendly but very capable if you like tinkering.\n\n**Note:** Wireless PCVR doesn't require fast internet - it only needs a good local network. All streaming happens between your PC and headset on your LAN."
