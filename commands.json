Users may experience latency spikes or see black bars when turning their head.\n\nTo correct this, please try the steps below.\n\nStep 1:  Opt into the Public Test Channel (PTC) to get version 55, which does not have this bug. To opt-in, open your Quest mobile app, go to 'Devices', then 'Headset Settings', and then 'Advanced Settings'. If 'Public Test Channel' is disabled, click on it to enable. Please note, while PTC versions can offer early access to new features, they may also have their own bugs.\n\nStep 2: In your headset go to settings, system, software updates and see if you have an update available. If not, turn on your headset, connect it to wifi, plug the charger into it and set it down on a flat surface. It will update soon. Sometimes in a few minutes, sometimes it could take a few hours.\n\nAs a last resort, you could perform a factory reset and avoid enabling any experimental features. However, this solution may not work for everyone.\n\nMeta is aware of the issue and is working on a permanent fix."
