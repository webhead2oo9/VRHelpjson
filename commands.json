Users may experience latency spikes or see black bars when turning their head.\n\nTo correct this, please try the steps below.\n\nStep 1:  Opt into the Public Test Channel (PTC) to get version 55, which does not have this bug. To opt-in, open your Quest mobile app, go to 'Devices', then 'Headset Settings', and then 'Advanced Settings'. If 'Public Test Channel' is disabled, click on it to enable. Please note, while PTC versions can offer early access to new features, they may also have their own bugs.\n\nStep 2: In your headset go to settings, system, software updates and see if you have an update available. If not, turn on your headset, connect it to wifi, plug the charger into it and set it down on a flat surface. It will update soon. Sometimes in a few minutes, sometimes it could take a few hours.\n\nAs a last resort, you could perform a factory reset and avoid enabling any experimental features. However, this solution may not work for everyone.\n\nMeta is aware of the issue and is working on a permanent fix."

        "description": "Connecting your Quest VR headset with your VR ready PC using a USB cable allows you to play VR games from your PC, this includes Oculus rift games and Steam games. However, when purchasing a cable there are a few things to take into account: \n\n**USB Connection types**\nUSB cables can come with mutliple different connector types, the ones you want to be looking for are USB type A and USB type C. All current Quest devices use a USB C port, which means that your cable needs to have at least *one* USB C connector, the other end can be either A or C; other than their shape and respective port they offer no real difference in this use case and they will perform the same.\n\n**USB standards**\nUSB standards (data speed simply said) are important for link cables, any link cable used for any of the Quest devices should be USB 3.0, also known as USB 3.1 Gen 1, and USB 3.2 Gen 1x1.\nNote that USB 2.0 will provide a very poor experience so avoid using those.\nYou can find these types of cables on A and C through various retailers at various lengths, performance-wise they are all equal.\n\n**Length**\nFor an optimal experience you ideally want a cable that is 3-5m long, generally it is not recommended that USB 2.0/3.0 cables are longer than that.\n\n**Battery time with a USB cable**\nIt is not garuanteed that a cable grants you infinite playtime, a lot of PC USB ports are simply not powerful enough to satisfy the needs of Quest devices. In most cases you will increase playtime by a few hours and in rare cases you might be able to actively charge while playing, this is all determined by your motherboard and not the cable.\n\nFor cable recommendations with detailed descriptions, use /linkcables.",
